                A blockchain (from the English block chain — a chain of blocks) is a continuous
                sequential chain of blocks containing various kinds of information. At the same time, each block
                contains not only its own information, but also information about all previous blocks (encrypted in the
                form of a so-called "hash"). These blocks are stored on the computers of many independent users. Thus,
                unlike conventional databases, it is almost impossible to change or delete information once added to the
                blockchain.
